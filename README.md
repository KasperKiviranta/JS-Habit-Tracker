## 🪞 Reflection & Self-Assessment

### Learning Reflection

Building this project helped me with understanding how front-end applications manage their data, user input and visual state together. I learned how to create a fully functional interface using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without relying on any frameworks. Managing habits with array of Boolean values showed me how simple data structures can drive UI behavior. I practiced dynamically rendering elements, updating them in response to events and persisting everything data related in `localStorage`.

Working on layout and styling improved my grasp of CSS positioning and responsive design. Testing dark mode made me more aware of accessibilitity and visual side of web development.

Through debugging, I improved at reading console errors and tracing state changes. If I continued developing the project I would add weekly history tracking. Overall this project gave me practical confidence in building browser based tools and applying JavaScript  in structured way.
