🪞 Reflection & Self-Assessment

Building this project helped me understand how front-end applications manage data, user input, and visual state together. I learned how to create a fully functional interface using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without relying on frameworks. Managing habits with an array of Boolean values showed me how simple data structures can drive meaningful UI behavior. I practiced dynamically rendering elements, updating them in response to events, and persisting everything in localStorage.

Working on layout and styling improved my grasp of CSS positioning and responsive design. Testing dark mode and different screen widths made me more aware of accessibility and contrast. I also realized the importance of separating logic from presentation—keeping rendering and data updates in different functions made the code cleaner and easier to extend.

Through debugging, I improved at reading console errors and tracing state changes. If I continued developing the project, I would add weekly history tracking and data export syncing. Overall, this project gave me practical confidence in building browser-based tools and applying JavaScript fundamentals in a structured way.
